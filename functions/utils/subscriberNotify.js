// email_subscriptions had a working double opt-in, an unsubscribe token, and a
// `last_email_sent` column since January -- and no sender at all. /subscribe
// promised "Never Miss a Show" and delivered nothing to anyone.
//
// Deliberately modelled on bandFollowNotify.js rather than written fresh: that
// path already solved per-recipient recovery, and its failure mode is recorded
// in CLAUDE.md ("do not reintroduce a fire-once latch without per-follower
// tracking -- it silently drops fans whose first send failed"). The same
// applies here, so the same shape applies: CLAIM before sending, release the
// claim if delivery fails, and let a later resend pick up only the gaps.

 * for the event lookup and the audit row.
