// Shared "band joined the lineup" notification logic for band followers.

// Sends the announcement email to each given follower and records every
// SUCCESSFUL delivery in band_follow_notifications, keyed by (performance,
// follower). This lets a resend target only followers who were not yet
// notified for a performance — guaranteeing eventual delivery without ever
// double-sending. Used by the announce flow (bands/[id].js) and the resend
// endpoint (bands/[id]/resend-announcement.js).

// A claim is not a delivery record (#1152).
//
// This module used to use ONE row to mean both "I am sending to this person"
// and "this person has been sent to". A Worker that died between the two --
// the crash window is a real network round-trip wide -- left a row that every
// later reader, resends included, read as "already notified". The follower was
// dropped permanently and silently, which is the worst shape a mail bug takes.
//
// So claimed_at and delivered_at are separate columns, and an UNDELIVERED
// claim past its lease is treated as abandoned and retryable. The lease is
// what makes that safe: without it "retry stale claims" degrades into "retry
// everything", which would re-mail the entire history.
