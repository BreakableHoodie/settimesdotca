## Troubleshooting

### "I can't add a performance - the venue dropdown is empty"

**Solution:** Add venues first! Go to Venues tab and create your venues before adding performances.

### "I see a conflict warning but the times look right"

**Solution:** Make sure you're looking at the full time range. A band ending at 9:00pm conflicts with another starting at 9:00pm. Leave at least 15-30 minutes between acts for setup.

### "My changes aren't showing on the public schedule"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure the event is Published (not Draft)
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for the cache to update
3. Refresh the public page

### "I accidentally deleted a performance"

**Solution:** Unfortunately, deletions are permanent. You'll need to re-add it manually. Double-check before clicking delete!

### "The site isn't loading on my phone"

**Solution:**
1. Try refreshing the page (pull down to refresh)
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try a different browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
4. Make sure you're at the correct URL
5. Contact support if it still doesn't work

### "I can't delete a venue"

**Solution:** You cannot delete a venue that has performances assigned to it. You need to:
1. Go to Performers tab
2. Find all performances at that venue
3. Either delete them or assign them to a different venue
4. Then you can delete the venue
