/**
 * Guard: a URL path segment is treated as an id only in its canonical spelling.
 *
 * THE BUG (#1120). Three band routes decided "id or slug?" with
 * `!isNaN(x) && parseInt(x) > 0`, which accepts values that then resolve to a
 * record the URL does not name:
 *
 *   "1.9"  -> parseInt 1   band 1
 *   "1e2"  -> parseInt 1   band 1, though Number("1e2") is 100
 *   "0x10" -> parseInt 16  band 16, from a hex string
 *
 * On these routes a non-numeric segment falls through to a NAME lookup, so the
 * failure is silent: /api/bands/0x10 returns band 16 rather than 404. Two URLs
 * for one record is a canonical-URL problem in a repo that maintains 301s for
 * exactly that reason (#983).
 *
 * `validateId` does NOT close this — it coerces with Number() and accepts both
 * exotic forms. That is correct for ITS job (validating something already meant
 * to be an id) and wrong for this one (choosing between two readings of a path
 * segment). The two are deliberately separate; this file asserts the difference
 * so nobody "simplifies" one into the other.
