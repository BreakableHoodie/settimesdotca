# Every linter's file list. `--others --exclude-standard` adds files that are
# untracked but NOT gitignored: a brand-new file you have not `git add`ed is the
# one most likely to be wrong, and a bare `git ls-files` would skip it. Each
# recipe still tests `[ -f ]`, because this list also names TRACKED files that
# have been deleted but not yet staged — a legitimate state that would otherwise
# hand a missing path to the linter and fail the gate for no reason.
LINT_FILES := git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard
#
# Recipes read this list with `while IFS= read -r f` REDIRECTED FROM A FILE, not
# `for f in $(...)` and not a pipe. `for` word-splits on spaces and re-globs, so
# `bad name.yml` became two nonexistent paths that `[ -f ]` skipped — an invalid
# file linted by nobody, exit 0. A pipe would fix the splitting but run the loop
# in a subshell, where `rc=1` never reaches the recipe. Redirecting from a file
# gets both. Filenames containing NEWLINES are still out of scope; that needs
# -z/`read -d ''`, which is bash, and this Makefile is /bin/sh.
#
# Enumeration failure is checked explicitly. Without it, a failing `git ls-files`
# writes an empty list, the loop body never runs, rc stays 0, and the gate
# reports success having linted NOTHING — the same silent-pass shape as the
# missing .PHONY entry. lint-sql needs its own handling because a pipeline
# reports the LAST command's status, so a filter's success would mask git's
# failure. The filter is sed, not grep: grep exits 1 on "no match" AND 2 on a
# read error, so the `|| true` needed to tolerate the former also swallowed the
# latter. sed exits 0 when it deletes nothing and non-zero only on a real error.
