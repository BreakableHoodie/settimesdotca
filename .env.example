# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================
#
# 1. PASSWORD STRENGTH
#    - ADMIN_PASSWORD: 16+ characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols
#    - MASTER_PASSWORD: 20+ characters, extremely complex
#    - Never use common words or patterns
#    - Use a password manager to generate and store
#
# 2. PASSWORD STORAGE
#    - ADMIN_PASSWORD: Can be shared with trusted organizers
#    - MASTER_PASSWORD: ONLY in developer's password manager
#    - Never commit actual passwords to git
#    - Never send passwords via email or SMS
#
# 3. PASSWORD ROTATION
#    - Rotate ADMIN_PASSWORD every 3-6 months
#    - Rotate MASTER_PASSWORD annually
#    - Rotate immediately if compromise suspected
#
# 4. CLOUDFLARE PAGES SETUP
#    - Set these as encrypted environment variables
#    - Configure separately for Production and Preview environments
#    - Use different passwords for dev/staging/production
#
# 5. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
#    - Copy this file to .dev.vars (gitignored)
#    - Use test passwords for local development
#    - Never use production passwords locally
#
# 6. TRANSMISSION SECURITY
#    - Always use HTTPS for admin panel access
#    - Never access admin panel over public WiFi
#    - Consider using VPN for additional security
#
# 7. ACCESS CONTROL
#    - Limit admin password sharing to essential personnel only
#    - Revoke access by changing password when someone leaves
#    - Monitor auth_audit table for suspicious activity
#
# 8. RATE LIMITING
#    - System locks out IPs after 5 failed attempts in 10 minutes
#    - Lockout duration: 1 hour
#    - All attempts logged in auth_audit table
