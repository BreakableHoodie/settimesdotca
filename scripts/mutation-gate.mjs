/**
 * mutation-gate — converts prose invariants into executable proof.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ----------------
 * This repo has a documented, recurring "vacuous test" defect class: tests
 * that pass against BOTH the correct and the broken implementation. The
 * worst instance (see CLAUDE.md "Band Announcements"): deleting
 * `AND verified = 1` from either band-announcement recipient query left all
 * 1,169 backend tests green, because ten test files all seeded
 * `verified = 1` — no fixture could distinguish a gated query from an
 * ungated one.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md documents many invariants in prose and asks contributors to
 * "verify by mutation" by hand. Nothing enforced that, so it decayed. This
 * script automates it: for each documented invariant, it applies the exact
 * one-line source mutation that would break it, runs the named test file(s),
 * and requires them to go RED. A mutation that does not go red is a real
 * vacuous-test gap — reported loudly, not swallowed.
 *
 * Scope (v1): backend (`functions/`) only. The frontend after-midnight
 * threshold (`frontend/src/utils/festivalDays.js`) runs under a SEPARATE
 * vitest project (`cd frontend && npm test`) with its own config, module
 * resolution, and jsdom environment — wiring it in here would mean either a
 * second vitest invocation with different flags/cwd or duplicating the
 * frontend config's `include`/environment, either of which is more moving
 * parts than this file's job warrants. Worth a v2 with its own
 * `frontend/scripts/mutation-gate.mjs`, not a branch in this one.
 *
 * Algorithm, per mutation:
 *   1. Read the target file.
 *   2. Assert `find` occurs EXACTLY ONCE. Zero occurrences or more than one
 *      is a GATE FAILURE, not a skip — patterns drift as code changes, and a
 *      gate whose patterns silently no-op reports all-green while testing
 *      nothing (see: `lint-md` missing from `.PHONY`, Makefile history).
 *   3. Write the mutated content.
 *   4. Run ONLY the listed test file(s) via `npx vitest run <files>`.
 *   5. Expect a NON-ZERO exit code. Zero (tests still pass against the
 *      broken code) is a SURVIVING MUTANT — a real vacuous-test finding,
 *      reported loudly with the invariant, file, and tests named.
 *   6. Restore the original content in a `finally`, then verify the restore
 *      both in-process (byte comparison) and via `git diff --quiet`. A
 *      restore that fails to verify exits non-zero immediately with a loud,
 *      specific message — leaving a mutated source file on disk silently is
 *      worse than any test failure this script could report.
 *
 * Refuses to run at all on a dirty working tree (scoped to the files this
 * table touches): the gate cannot tell its own mutation apart from a real
 * edit already in progress, and a crash mid-run could then destroy it.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *   node scripts/mutation-gate.mjs
 *   make mutation-gate
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  every mutation was caught (or is a documented KNOWN_SURVIVING gap)
 *   1  a gate failure (pattern drift), a genuine surviving mutant, or a
 *      restore that failed to verify
