# Priority Roadmap (Updated)

**Target Users:** Non-technical event organizers
**Event Frequency:** 4-5 times per year (every 2-3 months)

## Deprioritized/Rejected Features

- ❌ Event cloning - Not practical, risks avoidable mistakes
- ❌ CSV import/export - Too technical for target users
- ❌ Command line tools - Not user-friendly
- ❌ Multi-tenant architecture - Not needed yet

## Active Priorities (To Be Confirmed)

- Visual bulk operations (checkbox selection, move venue, delete, change time)
- Drag-and-drop image upload (event posters, band photos)
- Mobile admin optimization (touch-friendly interface)

**Note:** Priorities need user confirmation for current focus.
